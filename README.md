# Spellbound-Robot

As we were supposed to build something magical yet useful, we came up with the idea to build a robot (or shall we call it a goblin?) that reacts according to the spells cast through our webpage. It is a wireless robot that is connected to our webpage through API and can be controlled from anywhere. "Spells" can be cast through our webpage, where the user can order it to move into any direction.
